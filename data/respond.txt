Right, captain
Wait a minute

No problem
One moment
Be patient for a moment

My resistors are not designed for this.
Holy gears
I do not know how to answer this

This is beyond my intellect.
For this life did not prepare me

Hi friend, I'm bot Toto. I can help you to know marks, timetable and more. This is what I can do:<br><br>/marks<br>/timetable<br>/breaks
Unfortunately, without your data, I can not go to the diary.
Send me your username and password in this format "log:pas"
Great, now I can help with marks. Just send "/marks" when needed
Oops, it looks like something went wrong, check the correctness of the entered username and password and send them again
